# geo-viz
A Bicycle Geometry Visualization and Comparison app, made with P5.js.

Bicycle Geometry is the specification of angles and tubing length of a bicycle frame. Geometry affects everything from fit and handling to comfort and perceived ride quality.

If a person who is looking for a bicycle and would like to compare to a previous or currently owned bicycle, they may compare geometries. The geometry of two bikes can provide information on how they will ride, relative to the other. 

This app will allow users to input geometry data readily available from manufacturer's websites online, offline catalogs or hand measurement from two different bicycles and have them be overlaid. 

To Do:
- Finish the Bike Drawing.
- Genericize the inputs for more than 2 bikes. 
- Get the local storage values if any before the defaults.

Stretch Goals:
- Add a database of common makes and models. Perhaps find a way to scrape the data from manufacturer's websites.

Why P5.js:
It is a clean graphical package for javascript/Node.js with good documentation. It is simple but reasonably powerful without being overwrought.
